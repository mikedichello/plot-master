# Plot Master
Plot Master is a full-stack application which enables users to plan and visualize garden plots.
Users are able to create plots of custom dimensions, populate these plots with their choice of plants, save plots to their user profile, and edit or delete their plots. 
Users also may view a custom-generated chart of all plants in their plot along with planting and harvesting timelines, and a reference page with information about all plants in the database.

## Our Process


## Challenges/Future Goals
* We originally planned to use a third-party API, Trefle, to pull in a larger database of plants. However, many information fields with this API were listed as "null", and it became simpler to just create our own data for our initial production release. In the future we would like to figure out a more scalable solution to increase the size of our database.
* Another goal is to customize planting/harvesting time recommendations based off of a user's specified zipcode, using WeatherUnderground API's location-based frost dates.
* We also would like to explore using React DnD to create a drag and drop interface for the plot creation component
